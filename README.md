# SAR Displacement Monitoring

A completed final year engineering project focused on detecting and visualizing ground displacement using Sentinel-1 SAR data and Python automation.

---

## 🧾 Project Summary

This project automates pre-processing of Sentinel-1 SAR data using ESA SNAP (via Snappy), visualizes subsidence maps, and predicts displacement trends. It was developed as part of our final year submission at [Your College Name].

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python (Snappy, NumPy, Pandas)
- SNAP Toolbox
- Flask (for web automation)
- Leaflet.js (for map visualization)
- DEM data (for terrain validation)

---

## 🎯 Features

- SAR Data download and pre-processing
- Subsidence mapping using interferometric analysis
- Interactive map output using Leaflet.js
- Displacement rate prediction using time series modeling
- Automation through a Flask-based web app
